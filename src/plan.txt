- translate hamcycle index to snake linked list body
  - ensures that we can keep track of the range that the body covers
- define a separation that we will always maintain between the head and tail
- for all directions that the snake can move in the current position, next position:
   - must not be in the range covered from the head to the tail
   - must not skip the food
   - must maintain the separation
   - turn off skips while growing? or make separation liberal enough


what is the range covered from the tail index to the head index?
- start at head index, count backwards to tail index, that is the range
- counting backwards from index 0 leads to index rows*cols - 1

given head index and tail index, what is their separation distance?
- start at head index, count forwards to tail index
- counting forwards from index rows*cols - 1 leads to index 0

can we do this without counting and just some math???
- if head index is less than tail index, then it must be that the body has crossed the last index
- cannot use math for the range because that is a collection of values
- if h < t, then sep distance = (t-1) - h (distance from head to last index + tail)
- if h > t, then sep distance = (rows*cols-1) - h + t

h < t
snake = [3, 4, 5, 0]
h = 0
t = 3
sep = (3-1) - 0 = 2
sep squares = [1, 2], expected = 2

h > t
snake = [2, 3, 4]
h = 4
t = 2
sep = (6-1) - 4 + 2 = 3
sep squares = [5, 0, 1], expected = 3
